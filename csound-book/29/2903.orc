; MY SHOT AT A SIMULATED ANALOG SYNTH, LARGELY BASED ON MY JUNO ; BUT WITH MORE QUANTITATIVE EDITING OF PARAMETERS (AND MORE FLEXIBLE ; ONES IN SOME CASES).; THE ENVELOPE IS SORT OF CHEESY, AND THE RESONANCE SEEMS A LITTLE WEIRD ; BUT OTHER THAN THAT I THINK IT'S PRETTY COOL. ; IDETUNE REALLY HELPED FATTEN IT UP, BUT I MIGHT WANT TO SLAP SOME CHORUS ; ON THE END TOO. AND IDETUNE ONLY WORKS IF YOU'RE USING THE SUB OSCILLATOR. sr        =         44100kr        =         4410ksmps     =         10nchnls    =         1          instr 2903ilforate  =         5.1                      ; LFO SPEED IN Hzilfodelay =         0                        ; TIME BEFORE LFO STARTS, IN SECONDSilfopitch =         0                        ; EFFECT LFO HAS ON PITCH (FROM 0 TO 1)isawlvl   =         0.75                     ; LEVEL OF SAWTOOTH WAVEFORM isublvl   =         0.5                      ; LEVEL OF SUB WAVEFORMidetune   =         0.005                    ; HOW MUCH TO DETUNE SUB FROM SAWTOOTH inoislvl  =         0                        ; LEVEL OF RANDOM NOISE GENERATORihpffrq   =         0                        ; CUTOFF OF GLOBAL HIGH PASS FILTERivcffrq   =         600                      ; CUTOFF OF GLOBAL LOW PASS FILTER ires      =         0                        ; RESONANCE LEVEL (NEEDS TO BE REALLY LOW LIKE 0.001)ienvflt   =         100                      ; MAX CHANGE IN LPF CUTOFF BY ENVELOPE ilfoflt   =         50                       ; MAX CHANGE IN LPF CUTOFF BY LFO ikbdflt   =         0.1                      ; RELATIVE CHANGE IN LPF CUTOFF TO PITCH iattack   =         0.2                      ; ATTACK LENGTH COMPARED TO NOTE DURATION idecay    =         0.1                      ; DECAY LENGTH COMPARED TO NOTE DURATION isustain  =         0.8                      ; SUSTAIN LEVEL (1 IS FULL STRENGTH) irelease  =         0.2                      ; RELEASE LENGTH COMPARED TO NOTE DURATION isteady   =         1 - (iattack + idecay + irelease)   ; LENGTH OF SUSTAIN LEVEL; THE OSCILLATORSklfoenv   linseg    0, ilfodelay/2, 0, ilfodelay/2, 1, 1, 1 klfo      oscil     1, ilforate, 1asaw      oscili    isawlvl, p5 * (1+ klfo*ilfopitch), 3 asub      oscil     isublvl, p5/2 * (1 + idetune) * (1 + klfo*ilfopitch), 4 anoise    rand      inoislvlawaves    =         asaw+asub+anoise; THE ENVELOPEkenv      linseg    0, p3*iattack, 1, p3*idecay, isustain, p3*isteady, isustain, p3*irelease, 0 ; THE FILTERSahpfed    atone     awaves, ihpffrqklpfcut   =         ivcffrq + p5 * ikbdflt + ienvflt * kenv + ilfoflt * klfoalpfed    tone      ahpfed, klpfcutaresond   reson     ahpfed*ires, klpfcut, klpfcut/10 aflted    =         alpfed + aresondaout      =         p4*kenv*aflted          out       aout          endin
